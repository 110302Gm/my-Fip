        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Dr. Nut was a soft drink produced by the World Bottling Company based in New Orlean.
            <br>
          It was introduced in the 1930s and was produced until the late 1970s. The drink had a distinct almond flavor, similar to Amaretto liquor, 
          and was characterized by its plain logo depicting a squirrel nibbling on a large nut. 
          <br>
          Dr. Nut advertising used to feature a man on the beach, wearing half a nutshell as a bathing suit, and a squirrel as his friend.
           Many people dressed as this amusing figure during the New Orleans' Mardi Gras parades.
          <br>
           Nuts, including almonds, Brazil nuts, and cashews, are full of health benefits for teeth and gums, as they are packed with important elements like calcium and phosphorus.
           <br>.
           Calcium is a mineral that's known for building healthy bones, and it's found in dairy products, beans, some nuts and seeds, and leafy green vegetables
           <br>
           Therefore, consuming nuts and other calcium-rich foods can be beneficial for overall health, including teeth, gums, and bones.
